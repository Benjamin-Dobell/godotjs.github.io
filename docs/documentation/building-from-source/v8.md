# V8

`v8` is used as the default JavaScript runtime. 

## Build V8 from Source (Optional)

> **NOTE:**  See [Setup V8 in GodotJS](#setup-v8-in-godotjs) 
> if a prebuilt version of v8 from [GodotJS-Dependencies](https://github.com/ialex32x/GodotJS-Dependencies/releases) is used.

Building *V8* from source is needed if you do not want to use the prebuilt 
version from [GodotJS-Dependencies](https://github.com/ialex32x/GodotJS-Dependencies/releases). Follow the steps below:

**STEP 1**  
Download `depot_tools` from https://storage.googleapis.com/chrome-infra/depot_tools.zip if using `Windows`, and extract it to a path you want. 

Otherwise, get `depot_tools` from the git repository:

```
git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git
```

**STEP 2**  

Add the `depot_tools` path into the environment variable `PATH`.

On `windows`:

```bat
set PATH=Your\Path\To\depot_tools;%PATH%
set DEPOT_TOOLS_WIN_TOOLCHAIN=0
```

> **NOTE:**  If `DEPOT_TOOLS_WIN_TOOLCHAIN` is not set, `depot_tools` will fail to build because it will try to use the google internal toolchain instead of the locally installed Visual Studio.

On `linux`, `macos`:
```sh
export PATH=Your/Path/To/depot_tools:$PATH
```

**STEP 3**  

Sync and fetch v8:

```sh
cd Your/Path/To/depot_tools
gclient 

mkdir -p Your/Path/To/v8 
cd Your/Path/To/v8
fetch v8
cd v8
git checkout refs/tags/12.4.254.20
gclient sync
```

**STEP 4**  

Generate build configurations:

```sh
gn gen ./out.gn/x64.release
```

Modify the options in `out.gn/x64.release/args.gn`. See [Options](#options-currently-used-for-building-v8)


**STEP 5**  

Build:

```sh
ninja -C ./out.gn/x64.release v8_monolith
```

### Options Currently Used for Building V8

Windows x64
```toml
is_component_build = false
is_debug = false
target_cpu = "x64"
target_os = "win"
v8_enable_i18n_support = false
v8_monolithic = true
v8_use_external_startup_data = false
v8_enable_pointer_compression = true
v8_jitless = false                  # jit enabled

use_custom_libcxx = false            # false will produce warnings
treat_warnings_as_errors = false    # 
v8_symbol_level = 0                 # smaller lib 
v8_enable_sandbox = false 
```

Macos arm64
```toml
# v8_enable_backtrace = true
# v8_enable_disassembler = true
# v8_enable_object_print = true
# v8_enable_verify_heap = true

dcheck_always_on = false

is_component_build = false
is_debug = false
target_cpu = "arm64"
v8_target_cpu = "arm64"
target_os = "mac"
v8_enable_i18n_support = false
v8_monolithic = true
v8_use_external_startup_data = false
v8_enable_pointer_compression = true
v8_jitless = false                  # jit enabled
v8_enable_webassembly = false

use_custom_libcxx = false            # false will produce warnings
treat_warnings_as_errors = false    # 
v8_symbol_level = 0                 # smaller lib 
v8_enable_sandbox = false 
use_rtti = true
```

## Setup V8 in GodotJS
Follow the instructions below to set it up:

**STEP 1:** Download or clone the repo into the `modules` directory of your Godot engine source:

```sh
cd YourGodotEngineSource/modules
git clone https://github.com/ialex32x/GodotJS.git
```

**STEP 2:** Put `v8` headers and libraries into `GodotJS`, or directly download the prebuilt `v8` from [GodotJS-Dependencies](https://github.com/ialex32x/GodotJS-Dependencies/releases):

```sh
# download the archive of prebuilt v8 
curl https://github.com/ialex32x/GodotJS-Dependencies/releases/download/v8_12.4.254.21_r13/v8_12.4.254.21_r13.zip --output your/download/path/v8.zip

# extract the zip file into your `GodotJS` directory, 
# NOTE: no white space after the switch `-o`
7z x -o"YourGodotEngineSource/modules/GodotJS" your/download/path/v8.zip 
```

> **NOTE:**  Don't forget to put the headers/libraries of `v8` into the same directory structure used in prebuilt `v8` if you decide to compile it by yourself.

The module directroy structure looks like this:
```
┗━ godot
    ┗━ modules
        ┣━ ...
        ┣━ gltf
        ┣━ GodotJS
        ┃    ┣━ bridge-quickjs
        ┃    ┣━ bridge-v8
        ┃    ┣━ ...
        ┃    ┣━ lws
        ┃    ┗━ v8
        ┃        ┣━ include
        ┃        ┣━ linux.x86_64.release
        ┃        ┣━ macos.arm64.release
        ┃        ┣━ windows_x86_64_release
        ┃        ┗━ ...
        ┣━ gridmap
        ┣━ ...
```

The currently used version of `v8` is `12.4.254.21`.

**STEP 3:** Compile and launch `Godot Editor`. Then, you can create a Godot project in TypeScript/JavaScript:
* [Create-a-TypeScript-Project-from-Scratch](Create-a-TypeScript-Project-from-Scratch)
* [Create-a-JavaScript-Project-from-Scratch](Create-a-JavaScript-Project-from-Scratch)

> **NOTE:**  Since the prebuilt `v8` library is built with the `windows-latest` github runner which uses VS2022, encountering `Unresolved external symbol` errors during linkage with `v8_monolith.lib` or `libucrt.lib` may be addressed by updating to the latest version of the `MSVC v143` toolchain, `Windows Universal CRT SDK` and `Visual Studio 2022` itself. See [GodotJS-Dependencies README](https://github.com/ialex32x/GodotJS-Dependencies) for the version of MSVC C++ Compiler used in different prebuilt library packages.

A prebuilt version of `Godot Editor` can be downloaded from [GodotJS-Build](https://github.com/ialex32x/GodotJS-Build/releases).  
**Because the GodotJS-Build workflow is currently run manually, it may not be built from the latest commit of `GodotJS`.**
